Text: 

Africa as a region bears more than 24% of the global burden of disease but has access to only 3% of the world's health workers and less than 1% of the world's financial resources. 

We address this critical shortage of healthcare workers by investing in a sustainable training model for frontline workers.  We work alongside field partners to identify critical needs and the innovative methods to address them, including training, modifying workflow or by facilitating access to essential tools and medications.

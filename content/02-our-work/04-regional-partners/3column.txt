_DRC - N Kivu - Goma_
Our partnership with HEAL Africa began in 2005, allowing us to aid in establishing the first perinatal transmission program in Goma. 

In 2006, we co-founded the Children’s AIDS Program and garnered the support of The Clinton Foundation which provides antiretroviral medication for 400 HIV+ children. 

As a field partner, HEAL Africa has worked with Global Strategies on several projects including, PEP, PMTCT, pediatric HIV, rehabilitation, and Advancing Baby Care.

##Halt SIDA

_DRC - Bukavu_
Our partner’s name, “Halt SIDA" translates to “Stop AIDS.” They use a peer educator
model with particular focus on vulnerable youth to address gender roles, healthy
sexuality, family planning, and HIV prevention. Sex and HIV/AIDS education for
youth has a dramatic impact on behavior modification and protects both sexes from
HIV and young women from teen pregnancy.

Halt SIDA trains volunteer peer educators who work with a supervisor to raise awareness among their friends and colleagues in school, university and the community.

Volunteer peer educators are trained through extensive workshops covering HIV/AIDS and related issues including life skills, social mobilization, and effective communication. Peer educators receive training materials (condoms, leaflets, posters, etc.) and routine evaluation to further their development. Through a cadre of 24 volunteers, more than 8,500 youths can be reached annually.

##Panzi Hospital

_DRC - S Kivu_
Global Strategies began partnering with Panzi Hospital in 2009 to deliver post-rape healthcare to rape survivors.

The project expanded in 2012 by providing access to 2,000 post-rape health kits, called the Prévention Pack, to survivors in the South Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The expanded project includes intensive training with experts in the field of sexual violence and an improved regimen of prescribed medications.

The advantage of the “Prévention Pack” is that it requires fewer pills that are easier to tolerate.  With the use of the Prévention Pack we hope to provide more effective HIV prevention.
